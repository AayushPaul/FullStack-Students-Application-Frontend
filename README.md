# About

This is the frontend of this full-stack application using JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap in VS Code. This is a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application powered by Spring Boot, Java, React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The web application allows college counselors to add students to the online system with their semester GPAs, so that college faculty can determine which students made the Dean's List. Any college can use this application, and students who have at least a 3.5 GPA make the Dean's List!
